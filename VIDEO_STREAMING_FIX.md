# Video Streaming Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Streamlit Toolbar Missing
**Problem**: Professional CSS was hiding the Streamlit toolbar and deployment buttons.

**Solution**: Added CSS rules to preserve Streamlit's core functionality:
```css
.stToolbar {
    display: block !important;
    visibility: visible !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    z-index: 999999 !important;
}
```

### 2. HLS Video Streaming Error
**Problem**: VideoDB HLS streams (.m3u8) failing with "Client Error: Video source error"

**Root Cause**: 
- Streamlit's native video player has limited HLS support
- Modern browsers require JavaScript libraries to handle HLS streams
- CORS and cross-origin issues with external video sources

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Enhanced HLS Player with hls.js
- Added professional HTML5 video player with hls.js support
- Includes error recovery mechanisms
- Supports both native HLS (Safari) and JavaScript-based playback

#### B. Multiple Fallback Options
1. **VLC Media Player** (Recommended)
   - Direct download link provided
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Reliable HLS playback

2. **Online HLS Players**
   - Links to web-based HLS players
   - No software installation required

3. **Stream URL Access**
   - Easy copy/paste functionality
   - Works with any HLS-compatible player

## Testing Your Videos

1. **Try the enhanced player first** - Should work in most modern browsers
2. **Use VLC as backup** - Most reliable option for HLS streams
3. **Check online players** - Good for quick testing

## For Developers

### Video Player Implementation
```python
from src.utils.video_utils import VideoFormatHandler

# Use the enhanced video player
VideoFormatHandler.display_video_player(stream_url, clip_title, clip_index)
```

### Common HLS Issues and Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Network Error | Connectivity/CORS | Retry with error recovery |
| Media Error | Codec/Format issue | Try different quality |
| 403 Forbidden | Authorization | Check VideoDB API permissions |
| 404 Not Found | Invalid URL | Verify stream generation |

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Native HLS | With hls.js | Recommended |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Safari | ✅ Yes | ✅ Enhanced | Use native |
| Chrome | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Use hls.js |
| Firefox | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Use hls.js |
| Edge | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Use hls.js |

## Quick Troubleshooting

1. **Video not loading?**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Use VLC as fallback

2. **Streamlit toolbar missing?**
   - Ensure professional CSS includes toolbar preservation
   - Check for conflicting CSS rules

3. **Performance issues?**
   - VideoDB Timeline API is more reliable than legacy streams
   - Prefer Timeline URLs over regular stream URLs
